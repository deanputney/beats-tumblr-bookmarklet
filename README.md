# Tumblr bookmarklet for [TheBeats.biz](http://thebeatsbiz.tumblr.com)

Primarily meant for quick publishing of Bandcamp albums to our Tumblr. Pre-populates a few desired fields, namely title and a series of tags based on the artist and album name, price, and tags.

Save the contents of [bookmarklet-encoded.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanputney/beats-tumblr-bookmarklet/master/bookmarklet-encoded.js) as a bookmark to use this tool.

## Build process

After making changes to `bookmarklet.js`, run `make` to rebuild the URL encoded version of the bookmarklet. Commit the new encoded version of the tool with your changes so it can be easily installed.
